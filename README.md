# LiarsDie

The Liar’s Dice game is played with two players who each have five dice.

Player 1 “bids”: they state a face value (1-6) and a guess for the minimum number of dice that they believe show that face value.

Player 2 either raises, or calls “LIAR!” (challenges). If they raise, they guess a higher number for the same face value. Play continues until one player challenges. 

If a player challenges, the previous player (“bidder”) wins if the number of dice that shows the face value in question is at least as high as the current bid. If not, the “challenger” wins.

(Note: in the real version, this would just be one round, and the loser of a round would lose one die. We would then continue playing until one player loses all his or her dice. You will not be implementing the full version in this project.)

Player types:
1.Smart Player - implements smart strategy
2.Random Player, every choice is random
3.Human Player, user makes all decisions

theres no human vs human option (because program displays the human roll)
